# literally-hello-world
Bruteforce until it prints `Hello World!`

## How it works

1. Each letter is stored in [letters/](https://github.com/andytubeee/literally-hello-world/tree/main/letters)
2. In each letter py file, the corresponding letter is being written to a file
3. In our [main.py](https://github.com/andytubeee/literally-hello-world/blob/main/main.py), each letter write function is imported and called
4. Everything is scrambled and randomly shuffled
5. Program will exit when `Hello World` is printed
