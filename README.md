# literally-hello-world
Bruteforce until it prints `Hello World!`

## How it works

1. Each letter is stored in [letters/](https://github.com/andytubeee/literally-hello-world/tree/main/letters)
2. In each letter py file, the corresponding letter is being exported
3. In our main.py, each letter is being imported
4. Everything is scrambled and randomly shuffled
5. Program will exit when `Hello World` is printed
